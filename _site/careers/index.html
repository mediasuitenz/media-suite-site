        <p>We are looking for JavaScript and Node.js developers to join out team&hellip;</p>

    <h1 class="lowercase underline-orange">A Career with us</h1>
    <div class="career-with-us align-left">
      <p>Our employment philosophy is simple. We look for the right people and then do what it takes to get them on board and keep them around. We aren’t scared to invest in the right people; the raw material we value is mindset over skillset.</p>
      <p>If you genuinely thrive on challenge and living outside your professional-comfort zone, better yet if you can view your failures (as well as your successes) as something to be owned, as opportunities for growth and learning – then we would like to talk.</p>

      <h2>Culture of Learning</h2>
      <p>Wherever you fit in the team, we are committed to pushing our boundaries and lifting our game. All. Of. The. Time. We do that by prioritising learning and knowledge sharing and seeking opportunities for professional development, mentoring and peer review. We respect that everybody likes to learn differently, and we make space for that, the only non-negotiable is a genuine passion for getting better at what you do and a willingness to share that journey with your team.</p>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>We do work for local and central government, national and international business and a handful of charitable organisations. Our projects are generally interesting, large enough to get your teeth into but not so big that you get bogged down forever. Whether it is designing, building and supporting a website, managing a digital marketing campaign, or architecting, prototyping and developing custom web-based software, we pride ourselves on being design-led, technically-focused builders of excellent solutions.</p>

      <h2>Why do we do it</h2>
      <p>Because we care about our clients. We are proud to deliver them value and get excited by being part of their growth and success.</p>

      <h2>Studio Team: Development Team</h2>
      <p>As we have grown, we have found the most natural sub-groupings within the Media Suite team to be “Studio” and “Development”. For us, the most important thing is to use the discoveries that we make apart, to strengthen the team as a whole and support change and learning.</p>
      <h3>Thoughtful Design. Clever Technology.</h3>
      <p>The Studio is where we refine the artform which we call Thoughtful Design. It is within this team that strategy, research and analysis meet UI, UX and visual design - before front-end development delivers our clients with intuitive, usable (and beautiful) results.</p>
      <p>The Development team is where we put the clever in Clever Technology. The dev-team is a multi-developer environment, committed to a culture of testing, automation, peer review, knowledge sharing, professional development, remote working and embracing change.</p>
      <p>The boundaries between teams are soft; wherever you sit, there will be robots, drones and more internet meme’s than you can shake a stick at.</p>


      <h2>How we do it</h2>
      <p>For us, Agile is more than a methodology, it is a philosophy that we try really hard to implement far beyond our approach to building software, and right down into our business systems and processes.</p>
      <h3>Design-led. Agile. Responsive.</h3>
      <p>When we build solutions, we focus on short development iterations and a tight feedback loop. Talking to our clients early and often allows us to put detailed design mockups in front of them before we write a single line of code (because changing pixels is an order of magnitude easier than changing code). From there, we aim for getting working software in front of the end users as early and often as possible. This approach makes us more productive and allows us to deliver better-tailored solutions on smaller budgets.</p>
      <h3>Test Driven</h3>
      <p>We write code to test our code. We are committed to automating the process of testing, which lets us make changes quickly without the constant fear of breaking functionality. This reduces the long-term cost of development and allows us to make mid-course corrections when they are needed most. The importance of testing the code we write, led us to embed the expectation of testing at every level of our work.</p>
      <h3>Architecture - Minimising Complexity, Maximising Efficiency</h3>
      <p>We aim to architect simply, with clear layers of abstraction and modular design. We look to optimise code re-use, improve our efficiency, and reduce the rate of software defects at every stage.</p>

      <h2>Where we do it</h2>
      <p>Oh, did we mention we’re also happy to hire remote - we are committed to building and supporting a remote working culture – and currently have people based in Christchurch, Wellington, Vietnam and Oslo, and from time to time working from cafes, houses, the kitchen table, ferries, trains &amp; airports.</p>

      <h2>A feel of our flavour</h2>
      <p>If you were part of the Media Suite Team over the last year, you might have:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Attended company-wide Agile training.</li>
        <li>Been dispatched to the Melbourne JS conference, Scotland JS or Web Rebels in Oslo, Norway.</li>
        <li>Worked on a real time traffic monitoring and visualisation tool based on tracking bluetooth devices throughout a large New Zealand city.</li>
        <li>Contributed to a government-backed system to help plan, coordinate and collaborate on the Christchurch rebuild.</li>
        <li>Been introduced at one of our monthly developer meetings (where we reflect on and refine our processes and development standards).</li>
        <li>Enjoyed a retrospective session on a large project we recently rolled out.</li>
        <li>Added a ton of new features to a clever online professional development tool.</li>
        <li>Rolled out a large event website for a local council.</li>
        <li>Got your head into a web tool for visualising road safety data.</li>
        <li>Built a kiwisaver calculator.</li>
        <li>Been involved with planning one of our ‘Media Suite Hack Days’.</li>
        <li>Written an Online Marketing and Brand strategy for a chain of backpacker hostels in South East Asia.</li>
        <li>Created an email campaign for a high profile client.</li>
        <li>Eaten Yum Neua (pretty much any Wednesday).</li>
        <li>Joined a Thursday designer lunch (where the creatives find inspiration over curry).</li>
        <li>Enjoyed a Friday developer lunch (where one of the team presents &ldquo;something new&rdquo; over pizza or sushi).</li>
        <li>Programmed a flying drone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The techie stuff</h2>
      <p><strong>Node.js</strong> Our dev-team are evangelical Node.js converts and it’s about more than the drones. The asynchronous single-threaded event-oriented architecture of Node.js. frees our devs to create fast and scalable applications. Node.js’s ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections, makes it the perfect for data-intensive real-time applications (which is where we have particular expertise). Best of all, Node.js enables our devs to program front-end and back-end of applications using JavaScript which means the learning curve can be easily climbed.</p>
