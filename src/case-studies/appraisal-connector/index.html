      <p>Interlead chose Media Suite to develop the software behind Appraisal Connector&trade; - an online appraisal system designed to enhance the <span class="fancy-pants-font">professional learning</span> of New Zealand teachers.</p>

      <h2 class="lowercase">The Challenge</h2>
      <p>After years of <span class="fancy-pants-font">educational research</span> and following guidelines established by the New Zealand Ministry of Education, InterLEAD consultants developed the philosophy and ideas behind the Appraisal Connector&trade;.</p>
      <p class="space-below-please">Media Suite were able to capture that philosophy and develop an <span class="fancy-pants-font">intuitive web interface</span> that streamlines the review process, allowing teachers and schools to focus on continued professional development.</p>

      <h2 class="lowercase">Core Features</h2>
      <p class="space-below-please">
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Appraisal Scheduling</span><br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Professional Journals &amp; Goal Setting</span><br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">A Student Feedback Portal</span><br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Individual Reporting</span><br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">School Wide Reporting</span>
      </p>

      <p>The initial ‘bootstrap’ system was built very rapidly over a couple of months and used to cost effectively <span class="fancy-pants-font">test the market</span>. Features and users were rapidly added over the first year of operation. Now after three years of <span class="fancy-pants-font">continuous development</span> (including a near complete rebuild) Appraisal Connector™ offers a compelling set of features.</p>
      <p>In 2014 we added a new companion product called Leadership Reflector&trade; - focusing on the feedback of leaders.</p>
