      <h2 class="lowercase">The Challenge</h2>
      <p class="space-below-please">Marlborough District Council wanted to know how people were using the Marlborough Sounds, so they could improve services and facilities in the area and get a better picture of user needs. The council had a pile of interesting data that did not work well on a static map.</p>

      <p>They asked Media Suite to turn the data into an interactive app, and then a website. They wanted boaties, holidaymakers and locals to have a handy tool for enjoying their time in the Marlborough Sounds. The app, Cruise Guide, had to be as useful and user-friendly as possible.</p>

      <h2 class="lowercase">The Hurdles</h2>
      <p>Cellphone service is patchy in the Sounds, and users might not have online access to the app at all times. Maps had to be downloadable to the userâ€™s phone so they could be used offline. The maps themselves were complicated and there was a lot of data to squeeze in.</p>

      <p>Media Suite collected nautical charts, Land Information New Zealand aerial and topographical maps, tide data and charts. At least 25 Open Data sources were used. A drone was used to capture beautiful images of the Marlborough Sounds and the best swimming spots were plotted.

      <p>Usually, tidal information is only gathered at main centres like Picton. The app calculates secondary tidal information, meaning boaties can check the details of smaller bays and moorings without having to do annoying calculations for every spot they intend to visit.</p>

      <h2 class="lowercase">We Loved</h2>
      <p>The Media Suite team is proud of this project; the challenge of combining data sets, tackling user problems then using the same code base to make the app into a slick website (<a href="http://www.cruiseguide.co.nz">www.cruiseguide.co.nz</a>). We couldn't resist heading up to the Sounds in summer to &ldquo;test&rdquo; the app over a few beers, barbecue tongs in hand.</p>
