      <p>North South GIS specialise in the implementation of ArcGIS, one of the core components of the Forward Works Solution.</p>
      <p>Jacobs provided project leadership and specific domain knowledge, having been involved some of the early prototypes of the system.</p>
      <p>Media Suite designed and developed the web application that allows users to view, analyse and update projects via a web interface.</p>

      <h2>Core functionality of the viewer includes:</h2>

      <p class="space-below-please">
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Managing projects</span> - via a web interface including the detailing of impacts.<br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Map viewer</span> - which allows users to view projects in conjunction with relevant contextual data.<br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Time Slider</span> - a set of controls that allows you to visualise projects and their impacts over time.<br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Clash detection</span> - Detailing other projects that may clash with yours.<br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Opportunity detection</span> - Detailing other projects that may present an opportunity for collaboration.<br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Advanced search</span> - For detailed analysis of projects.<br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Importing of data</span> - automatically imports and updates data from 3rd party systems.<br/>
        <span class="fancy-pants-font">Exporting of data</span> - via a Web Feature Service (WFS Feed).<br/>
      </p>

      <h2>Agile</h2>
      <p>What was unique about the delivery was that the Agile methodology Scrum was chosen, adopted and largely driven by the client; LINZ. We believe this was one of the first times a government agency has adopted Scrum so wholeheartedly and built themselves into the process so fully. Everything from the supply agreement to delivery and application support has been centred around Scrum.</p>
