    <p>We cherish our culture, so every hire we make is carefully considered. If you’re tempted to join the Media Suite team, read on to see if our ideologies are aligned.</p>
    <p>We are a team of curious-minded people who support each other, hold robust debates and don’t mind helping each other move house at the weekend. We thrive on challenges, we view our successes (and failures) as opportunities for growth, and we never, ever want to stop learning.</p>
    <p>Our employment philosophy is simple. We look for the right people and then do what it takes to get them on board and keep them around. We aren’t scared to invest in the right people to help realise their potential.</p>
