      <p>We’re looking for a super-passionate individual to bring their A-game to the front-end development space in our close-knit team.</p>
      
      <p>While your mad skills are definitely important to us (for obvious reasons), what we’re really after is someone with a genuine passion for web technologies and best practice.</p>

      <p>You’ll need to be committed to constant learning, knowledge sharing and professional development. That’s the stuff that gets us out of bed in the morning.</p>

      <p>At Media Suite, we have a wide range of clients with marketing websites, but we are increasingly working with government agencies, building tools to help solve their complex and interesting problems. So if you’re up for a challenge and something a bit out of the box, you’ll fit right in here. </p>


      <h2 class="text-size-35">mad skills (min. 4 years commercial development experience)</h2>
      <ul class="fancy-pants-font">
        <li>Have naturally excellent HTML and CSS skills.</li>
        <li>Firm understanding of JavaScript and jQuery.</li>
        <li>An eye for UI, an interest in UX and a love of design (even if it's not your biggest strength personally).</li>
        <li>Experience with design tools like Photoshop, Sketch etc.</li>
        <li>Thorough understanding of RWD and extensive experience with methods/technologies used to implement responsive websites/apps.</li>
        <li>Ability to write clean, maintainable code. OCD tendencies welcome :)
</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-size-35">nice to have experience in:</h2>
      <ul class="fancy-pants-font">
        <li>CSS pre-processors such as SASS or Less.</li>
        <li>Working with JavaScript SPA frameworks such as Ember, Angular, React etc.</li>
        <li>Developing sites using Silverstripe and Wordpress.</li>
        <li>Developing pattern libraries/style guides and working on larger scale projects.</li>
      </uL>
      <br>
      <p>The core of our employment philosophy is simple. We look for the right people and then do what it takes to get them on board and keep them around. We aren’t scared to invest in people; because the raw material we value is mindset over skill set.</p>

      <p>So if you love developing high performance, reliable and maintainable front end code, can work across the lifecycle of a project, have no issue debugging/troubleshooting cross-browser, and can work in with our creative team and back end devs, we’d love to hear from you. We work in a largely scrum environment and we regularly peer review our work.</p>

      <p>We have a fantastic working culture here at Media Suite, and we expect all employees to be self-motivated and able to work independently or collaboratively. We offer flexible hours, an established and supported remoting culture, a permanent role with competitive remuneration, and a commitment to work-life balance. (We actually think it’s a pretty neat place to work!)</p>

      <p>We are really keen for this role to be based in our Christchurch office, so being based here with the right to work is key.</p>

      <p>If you have made it this far and are still interested, please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:studio@mediasuite.co.nz">studio@mediasuite.co.nz</a>.</p>

      <p class="fancy-pants-font">Please include a CV, a cover letter (tell us about yourself), and some examples of websites you’ve worked on exclusively (if possible) or in collaboration with others (tell us what parts you worked on).</p>
