      <p>We cherish our culture, so every hire we make is carefully considered. If you’re tempted by joining the Media Suite Team, be sure to read on and make sure our ideologies are aligned.</p>

       <p>We are a team of curious-minded people who support each other, hold robust debates and don’t mind helping each other move house on the weekend. We thrive on challenges, we view our successes (and failures) as opportunities for growth, and we never, ever want to stop learning.</p>

       <p>We value mindset over skillset and we believe the team is more powerful than the individual.</p>

       <p>Our employment philosophy is simple. We look for the right people and then do what it takes to get them on board and keep them around. We aren’t scared to invest in the right people to help realise their potential.</p>

      <h2 class="text-size-35">about the role</h2>
      <p>You will be embedded into a multi-developer JavaScript team committed to a culture of testing, automation, peer review, knowledge sharing, professional development, remote working and embracing change.</p>

      <h2 class="text-size-35">how we work</h2>
      <p>Our mandate is to build the right thing by combining thoughtful design with clever technology.</p>

      <p>We use Agile methods (mostly based on Scrum) to deliver our projects and continually reflect upon and make improvements to our systems and processes.</p>

      <h2 class="text-size-35">about the work</h2>
      <p>We build web applications for local and central government, national and international business, along with a handful of charitable organisations.</p>

      <p>Our projects are generally interesting. They are large enough to get your teeth into, but not so big that you get bogged down forever.</p>

      <p>We are excited to solve real world problems, actually making a difference in improving lives, the environment and efficiency.</p>

      <h2 class="text-size-35">flexibility</h2>
      <p>Talented creatives don’t necessarily want to live in the same city, working the standard 9-5 hours. In recognition of that, we’ve built and support a remote working culture.</p>

      <p>Our HQ is in Christchurch, but we also have people in Wellington, Hamilton, Nelson, Queenstown, Melbourne, Munich and Oslo. They work from offices, homes, the kitchen table, ferries and airports.</p>

      <p>Due to the diverse working locations (and time zones), we keep in close contact using tools like slack and screen hero. It takes planning and creativity to keep a cross timezone remote team humming - but we are committed to making it work.</p>

      <div class="padding-100-top align-center"><h1 class="lowercase underline-orange">skills and requirements</h1></div>

      <p>We’re looking for intermediate to senior level developers with a computer science (or equivalent) degree and a minimum of 4 years real-world experience. If you don’t hold a relevant degree or have the required experience and still wish to apply then please ensure you have a stellar cover page on your application.</p>

      <p>Ideally you would have experience with (or the ability to quickly learn) any of the following:</p>

      <p class="fancy-pants-font">Ember.js</br>
      Node.js</br>
      PostgreSQL</br>
      Other server side languages (python, ruby, php)</br>
      Docker</p>

      <p>We genuinely value cultural fit and attitude ahead of specific experience. Even if you don’t have quite the right skills but think you can bring something we need - please get in touch. Just to be clear... the only non-negotiable is someone who is going to write great code.</p>
