      </ul>

      <p>The good news is that we are looking for a talented software developer to join our team.</p>
      <p>Our projects are generally interesting, large enough to get your teeth into but not so big that you get bogged down forever. We offer variety so you need to bring flexibility.</p>
      <p>We use Agile methods (mostly based on Scrum) to deliver our projects and continually reflect upon and make improvements to our systems and processes.</p>
      <p>You will be embedded into a multi-developer environment committed to a culture of testing, automation, peer review, knowledge sharing, professional development, remote working and embracing change.</p>

      <p><strong>Ideally you would have experience with (or a burning desire to learn) any of the following:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>AngularJS or Ember.js</li>
        <li>SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)</li>
        <li>NoSQL databases (MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis)</li>
        <li>Other server side languages (ruby, python, php)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Why did we put the skill-set last? Because we genuinely value cultural fit and attitude ahead of specific experience. Even if you don’t have quite the right skills but think you can bring something we need - please get in touch. Just to be clear&hellip; the only non-negotiable is someone who is going to write great code.</p>
      <p>Oh and we’re happy to consider hiring remote - we currently have people based in Christchurch, Wellington and Oslo, and from time to time working from cafes, houses, trains &amp; airports.</p>
      <p>If you have made it this far and are still interested, please email something that resembles a CV and cover letter explaining why you might be a great addition to the team. If we feel there is a possible match, we’ll get in touch with you to arrange an informal chat.</p>
      <p>To find out about working with us, make sure you read our <a href="{{ "/careers" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">careers page</a>.</p>

      <p>P.S. Did we mention robots?</p>
