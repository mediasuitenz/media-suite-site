        <p>Therefore, except for any Intellectual Property in Your materials supplied to Us, we own all Intellectual Property in any website or system (including, the user and administration interfaces, measurement, administration and tracking tools) specifically including all new Intellectual Property (if any) developed or created by Us, our agents, employees and contractors. </p>
        <p>Equally, we may use our existing code-library to build components of any solution we build for you. Not only does this help to keep your costs down but it means tried and tested modules can be used with confidence. </p>
        <p>We retain ownership of all intellectual property (including copyright) in code or systems we create &amp; we grant a licence to you to use this code for your site or system. This means you can use and enjoy your site or system – or even take the &quot;source code&quot; to another developer to extend or maintain the system in the future (avoiding vendor lock-in). </p>
        <p>However, you cannot do certain things, such as use that code to create multiple, similar sites or sell or &quot;lend&quot; that code to any other person without our written consent. </p>
        <p>If you have any queries about our Intellectual Property clause and how it may relate to you please get in touch or consult your legal advisor. </p>
